This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

here is a education and school managment system by which there is a higher place for controlling schools and there are schools registered which control students, this is the inspiration of what it would look like if our government started this kind of system in which every school and student in each school can be tracked at anytime.
